You are staring at yourself. Eyes. Nose. Lips. Together you make up a whole person, with features that define a person. But there is more to you unraveling at the seams. 
There is something ringing in your ear and it wonï¿½t ever just stop. It scratches below the surface of the skin, never sated even you do rub your skin raw. At worst, it dials up your bitch levels to ten with constant tremors in your body in a world that will never let it rest.
In the quiet hours it subsides. 
At best, it becomes gentle. Slows from incessant ringing to a soothing slow type of rock. She seems to be saying something, her voice flows. 
The frequency in your brain hums. 
You wake up with a revelation. 
Her name is Maria.
