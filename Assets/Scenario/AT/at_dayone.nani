You are staring at yourself. Eyes. Nose. Lips. Together you make up a whole person, with features that define a person. But there is more to you unraveling at the seams. 

There is something ringing in your ear and it wonâ€™t ever just stop. It scratches below the surface of the skin, never sated even when you do rub your skin raw. At worst, it dials up your bitch levels to ten with constant tremors in your body in a world that will never let it rest. 

In the quiet hours it subsides. 

At best, it becomes gentle. Slows from incessant ringing to a soothing, slow type of rock. Her voice flows. She seems to be saying something. 

???: See how much nicer it is it when you listen to the words of god? 

The frequency in your brain hums.
