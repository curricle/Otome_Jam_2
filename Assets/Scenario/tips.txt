<br><br>MARIA: There is nothing to be—
<br>IOANNA: Gained, yes, yes. I understand.
<br>IOANNA: But it is important to canvass and to analyze.

<br><br>MARIA: Endurance racing is a form of motorspot that pushes both pilot and ship to the absolute limit. 
<br><br>MARIA: I have a difficult time imagining your jailbird succeeding in this avenue. 
<br>RAVEN: For some reason, I feel like you just really disagreed with that…
<br>IOANNA: I said no such thing.

# Raven
RAVEN | Person of Interest |
<br><b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Raven. Real name: ▮▮▮▮▮.
<br>He received his nom de plume during his maiden race. He’s Raven. No further questions. No interviews, no post-race debrief, no nothing.
<br>
<br>Former racing royalty, known across the galaxies for dead heat finishes and an awful personality. He’s larger than life, cruel and vindictive, and awfully quick to resort to violence. 
<br>
<br>The Raven you meet in Planet Estehelix is nothing of the sort. 
<br>
<br>He’s a death row prisoner, sent to the wastes of the universe to complete a life sentence after murdering hundreds of innocents at his final competition. He isn’t here to collect scrap, or to manage waste, or to better any sort of societal outcome. He looks at you with an expression that is both scathing and haughty and exhausted. He’s someone more than willing to kill you to end his own miserable existence.
<br>
<br>He’s addicted to the rush of flight but now that his wings have been cut, he is ready for his last flight into an impossible horizon. 
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>Raven has been self flagellating over something in his past that does not end up being his fault. 
<br>It’s something that they intended to do, sure. He put the explosives in his ship and he intended to blow himself up and anyone else who was too damn close. He was spiraling after consecutive losses and the threat of his agency sponsorship was pressing down on him and his life seemed meaningless. Without the thrill of the battle, there was nothing he could live for. 
<br>
<br>But…that didn’t happen. An engineer figured out his lukewarm attempt at suicide and was able to deactivate everything.
<br>
<br>The huge explosion that ruined his life was caused by some irrelevant atmospheric nonsense that was a one in a million chance of interacting with his equipment. 
<br>
<br>He’s a total failure. 
<br>He couldn’t even crash into the wall, he’s still spinning his wheels at the start of the race.
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>Raven is a creature of contradiction. He grew up on Estehelix and spent his summers racing. Like all people born and raised on Estehelix, he was made into a betting coin for the Pioneer Project. His life became intertwined with those who came to the entertainment district to strike it rich. With every grand prix win, he began to amass a terrible wealth.
<br>
<br>Raven knew he had an all encompassing mission. He’s a good kid. He spent his childhood growing up in the sheet metal streets and the memoria surgery tables. He spent his childhood getting organs swapped for something more particularized for the environment. He spent his teen years experimenting with what he could do. What he couldn’t. What was expected of him as a rising star and as the primary breadwinner for a decrepit neighborhood. Memoria seeped out of every orifice, it combined with his blood, when he raced, it became a part of his ship.

<br>The Belladonna, do not touch me.
<br>
<br><b>Are you having fun editorializing?
<br>It’s all “thinking” here. I know it’s your digital kingdom but everything is under my jurisdiction on this system.
<br>What else do you want? 
<br>Do you want to know about the people I slept with for a bit of money? For a piece of bread? Do you want to know about how wide I can open my mouth? 
<br>No? Maybe my dead heat finishes on the grid, then? Do you want to know about the people I had to sabotage to get to where I placed? Do you want to know about my affair with my mentor’s engineer? 
<br>Get out of my brain, [][][][][].
<br>I know you get a kick outta this sorta thing but it’s really pissing me off.
<br>At the end of the day, I lost. I died. I came back like a holy ghost. 
<br>Are you mad I took your girl?
<br>Oh, c’mon. Clearly, it aggravates you.
<br>Or…is it that cuz you can’t do anythin’ about it? 
<br>Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. 
<br>The me that lives, and the me that dies, and the me that lives here. 
<br>In between the lines of reality and dreams. 
<br>That is what Estehelix has always stood for.</b> 

# SunEater
THE SUN EATER | Person of Interest |
<br><b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Recollection’s beloved executioner and errand dog. A “Record Keeper”.
<br>
<br>She is a cool-headed and cold-hearted woman. Currently out of office on a more demanding mission. She takes her title seriously.
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>Worldly desires? Unnecessary. 
<br>
<br>Love? Romance? Camaraderie? All values to hold close with the capacity to abandon.
<br>
<br>The Sun Eater is a woman of renowned cruelty, but lately, there are rumors swirling around her previous assignment.
<br>
<br>Do not ask her about the Columbine’s final fate. Recollection cannot afford to replace more agents.  
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>Moira is not a happy woman. She understands the importance of running a tight ship. She understands the importance of a hierarchy. She understands how she has failed, and how she has succeeded. 
<br>
<br>She is nursing bruises that she cannot articulate.
<br>
<br>She does not care for this world. She does not care for the future. 
<br>
<br>She grinds her axe with the intention of lopping off Recollection’s head. 
<br>
<br>“Was this not the Moira who was kind and levelheaded? A polite, yet charming woman?”
<br>
<br>“Was this not the Moira with a 100% success rate?”
<br>
<br>“Was this not the Moira who brought the Kalmia Project to its knees? The one who was able to save the Columbine?” 
<br>
<br>“I…thought the Columbine died?” 

# Proxima
Proxima | Location | PROXIMA, THE PLANETARY SYSTEM THAT STARTED IT ALL. A BARREN LANDSCAPE, ONCE FILLED WITH THE ORIGINAL SPACERS. COLOGOMATE XXX BUILT THE ORIGINAL SPACE COLONIES HERES. 
<br>
<br>Humble in nature, there is nothing glamorous about these colonies. No shiny skyscrapers or towers, this was blue-collared in nature, never blue-blooded in wealth. These colonies were eventually forgotten, its people left to fend for themselves until waste management found the remains. 
<br>
<br>Proxima has three main planets, coded by -I, -II, and -III. Proxi-I has the cistern underground, Proxi-2 has the remains of a great flood, and Prox-3 has been razed down by time and a constant beratement of stars. Very dangerous. All that remains for your parameter is the old warehouse.. Whatever connecting orbital systems that joined these planets no longer work, they travel by ship. 
<br>
<br>If being here is technically against mission parameters, you don’t comment on it. 

# Estehelix
Estehelix | Location | Estehelix, the planetary system of entertainment and vice. Originally ruled by a rich conglomerate until a hostile takeover in 1092X.

<br>
<br>Known for its memoria basins. Memoria is a liquid that stems from natural reservoirs in the system. It takes the form of an individual’s memories. Not everyone can tap into memoria, but those who are skilled in its control are highly regarded. Charlatans of the highest order.
<br>
<br>Known for its racing circuit, grand theater, and skyline.
<br>
<br>Estehelix has three main planets, coded by -1, -2, and -3. Este-1 has the theater, Este-2 has the circuit, and Este-3 is the commercial and residential area. Each planet is connected by a train of sorts.
