ZINNIA: Come. Let’s go back to the ship. 
@char ZINNIA.EyesClosedSmiling
ZINNIA: There’s something I have to show you. 

The way her hands curl into the chains.

YOU: It’s time to go.
@char ZINNIA.PlayerNeutral
ZINNIA: Go where? 
YOU: Time to turn it all back in, silly!
ZINNIA: …
@char ZINNIA.LookingDown
ZINNIA: Is this not enough?
YOU: Don’t you love me? You told me you love me. 
YOU: I love you so much, and I understand if you were blinded by your vision. It’s not something to mourn, lovey. The immolation is pyre rites. It’s how we show our love. 
@char ZINNIA.LookingForward
ZINNNIA: Show our love…
YOU: Yeah! She’d reward us for this. I can feel it. I can feel her joy. 

YOU: You poor thing, you’ve been collecting all these years. Finding these beautiful items to communicate with her. But you didn’t realize that burning is what sets them free to her. 
YOU: That how she’s able to breathe, within the ash and smoke. 
YOU: That’s okay, she likes her sheep a little confused.

@hide ZINNIA
YOU GRAB ZINNNIA. PLACE HER HEAD IN YOURS. PRESS YOUR FOREHEADS TOGETHER FOR A SINGULAR MOMENT.

@char ZINNIA.LookingForward
YOU: Look at me, Zinnia. 
YOU: Does the god behind my eyes look like whatever was stripped from you? 
YOU: It’s okay that you were led astray. 
YOU: It’s why I’m here to shepherd you
ZINNIA: But - 
YOU: You need to dull your senses, and forget the material. They are just tools to amplify her voice. 
YOU: You can feel her behind my eyes right? 
YOU: You found your faith in me, right?
@char ZINNIA.LookingDown
ZINNIA: Yes…
YOU: You love me right?

Zinnia doesn’t reply. She doesn’t need to. 

Not right now. 

YOU: Let’s go back, yeah?
ZINNIA: Yeah.

YOU: It’s pretty right?
@char ZINNIA.Aloof
ZINNIA: Yeah…
YOU: They said we’ve done the company’s best. A whole new record! All that junk being used to fuel the galaxy. It’s amazing what we can accomplish together. 
YOU: That beautiful collection, I’m so glad we got to enjoy it, but you know? I think it looks prettier burning. Don’t you? <3

Zinnia’s fingers curl into your own. If she looks unsure and confused. She’s cuter that way. 

YOU: I love you.

@char ZINNIA.EyesClosed
You turn to face Zinnia. She doesn’t look at you. Doesn’t gaze into your deeply adoring eyes. 

You squeeze her hand, thumb digging into her palm.

ZINNIA: I love you, too.
