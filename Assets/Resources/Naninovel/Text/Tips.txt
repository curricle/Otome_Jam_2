# IOANNA
IOANNA | Person of Interest |
<b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Ioanna Arcensis.
<br>Waste Management’s “perfect and unfeeling” officer. 
<br>
<br>The Record Keepers, bastardized as “Recollection” by new hires and New Era junkies, outsources its less important employees from the Xyetha Corporation. Ioanna was a first wave hire. Since her unglamorous induction, she has climbed up the ranks–
<br>
<br><b><color=#578A9F>I do not particularly enjoy being the subject of your gaze, Maria.</color></b>
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>Ioanna Arcensis.
<br>Waste Management’s “one-hundred percent” completionist. 
<br>
<br>Recollection, or the process of cataloguing and incinerating Old World relics, is an ancient practice. It has its origins in the Adaamyr family, the Keeper’s founders. By now, it has become a means of colonization beyond the stars, which makes it a heavily funded enterprise.
<br>
<br>Ioanna has no interest in the Keeper’s lofty goals. She simply wants to Collect. Canvass. Assess. Destroy.
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>Ioanna Arcensis.
<br>My saintess, my saintess. 
<br>Waste Management is wasted on you. 
<br>I tell you this time and time again. 
<br>
<br><b>…and yet, you rebuke me at every turn.</b> 

# MARIA
MARIA | Person of Interest |
<b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Would it be incorrect to call myself your “Guardian Angel”?
<br>
<b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>[[Encrypted Transmission]] 
<br>“The Pioneer Project…how vile.”
<br>“That system is all about bread and circuses, huh.”
<br>“What a reference. Have you been reading a ton, Maria?”
<br>“I mean, a bit. It’s still weird that Recollection let something like that happen.”
<br>“Do you think…we’ll have to go there?”
<br>“It’ll probably sort itself out. Capsize. Explode. Y’know?”
<br>“I guess…”
<br>“A system that feeds on itself is not one that will survive, Maria. Those trailblazers will only see the Void at the end of their journeys.”
<br>“...I guess…sorry for bringing it up.”
<br>“Let’s go, Maria. We have a mission to prepare for.”
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>“Hey, Anna.”
<br>“Maria. What’s up?”
<br>“Do you think…this is enough? What we do?”
<br>“What do you mean?”
<br>“I get that we’re the Worst Girls in Recollection, and that we’re not particularly meant for a cosmic fate…”
<br>“But I’d like to think there’s more to life than the incinerator at the end of the journey.”
<br>“I’m scared of thinking like this…”
<br>“But I don’t want to live a half-life. I want to see the stars! The world! For everything they have to offer.”
<br>“Is that so bad?”
<br>“I’d like to transfer out. Of Waste Management."
<br>“...what?”
<br>“Oh, c’mon. Don’t look at me like that! It’d be good for us to explore other things, right?”
<br>“You’re happy here. I’m not.”

# CASTOR
CASTOR | Person of Interest |
<b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Castor, real name scrubbed from public record.
<br>Previously, a Record Keeper, currently, Ioanna Arcesnis’s “Manager”. 
<br>Bright and fun, she’s happy to yap away at Ioanna’s terminal, with little regard for how her Agent feels about it.
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>Castor’s work focused on Old World religious practices and customs. She wrote the most comprehensive text on a concept known as “Catholicism”. 
<br>Her fascination would eventually lead to her defection in Year XX29. 
<br>The Sun Eater brought her back.
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>“Oh, wicked Kalmia. Do you know what the greatest punishment for sinners is?”
<br>“...”
<br>“That is fine, then. I am happy to philosophize on my own.”
<br>“It is Pure Removal. Unfiltered access to our digital realm. If they want to live in an Old World, then, be consumed by the New Era’s greatest accomplishment.”
<br>“Become less than a person. Become more than a god. Become an eternal servant for our beautiful mission.”
<br>“...Is that all?”
<br>“Are you not thrilled at the culmination of your work with the Columbine, Kalmia?” 
<br>“...ah, he left.”

<br>RAVEN: You believe in ghosts but you don’t think I started racing at age 3?
<br>IOANNA: First—
<br><br>MARIA: To think a woman of your station takes stock in the supernatural.
<br><br>MARIA: A bit pathetic, no?
<br>IOANNA: I do not believe in ghosts.
<br>RAVEN: You nearly jumped outta your skin when I pointed out the taxidermy on the second floor.

<br>RAVEN: I’ve always been in the traditional sort, but for the last couple of years I was looking at doing endurance racing.
<br><br>MARIA: Endurance racing is a form of motorspot that pushes both pilot and ship to the absolute limit. 
<br><br>MARIA: I have a difficult time imagining your jailbird succeeding in this avenue. 
<br>RAVEN: For some reason, I feel like you just really disagreed with that…
<br>IOANNA: I said no such thing.
<br>RAVEN: …
<br>IOANNA: What made you change your mind?
<br>RAVEN: …
<br>IOANNA: Speak up.
<br>RAVEN: …the ships weren’t as nice.
<br><br>MARIA: …

# TheBelladonna
The Belladonna | Item | 
<b>ITEM DESCRIPTION:</b> The wreckage of Estehelix’s finest ship. The Belladonna.
<br>
<br>Record 964920:
<br>▮▮▮▮▮: I am going to kill you.
<br>▮▮▮▮▮: I am going to tear you from limb to limb. 
<br>▮▮▮▮▮: I’m going to watch your blood drain from your face and I am going to–
<br>IOANNA: Go ahead, then.

# Raven
RAVEN | Person of Interest |
<br><b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Raven. Real name: ▮▮▮▮▮.
<br>He received his nom de plume during his maiden race. He’s Raven. No further questions. No interviews, no post-race debrief, no nothing.
<br>
<br>Former racing royalty, known across the galaxies for dead heat finishes and an awful personality. He’s larger than life, cruel and vindictive, and awfully quick to resort to violence. 
<br>
<br>The Raven you meet in Planet Estehelix is nothing of the sort. 
<br>
<br>He’s a death row prisoner, sent to the wastes of the universe to complete a life sentence after murdering hundreds of innocents at his final competition. He isn’t here to collect scrap, or to manage waste, or to better any sort of societal outcome. He looks at you with an expression that is both scathing and haughty and exhausted. He’s someone more than willing to kill you to end his own miserable existence.
<br>
<br>He’s addicted to the rush of flight but now that his wings have been cut, he is ready for his last flight into an impossible horizon. 
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>Raven has been self flagellating over something in his past that does not end up being his fault. 
<br>It’s something that they intended to do, sure. He put the explosives in his ship and he intended to blow himself up and anyone else who was too damn close. He was spiraling after consecutive losses and the threat of his agency sponsorship was pressing down on him and his life seemed meaningless. Without the thrill of the battle, there was nothing he could live for. 
<br>
<br>But…that didn’t happen. An engineer figured out his lukewarm attempt at suicide and was able to deactivate everything.
<br>
<br>The huge explosion that ruined his life was caused by some irrelevant atmospheric nonsense that was a one in a million chance of interacting with his equipment. 
<br>
<br>He’s a total failure. 
<br>He couldn’t even crash into the wall, he’s still spinning his wheels at the start of the race.
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>Raven is a creature of contradiction. He grew up on Estehelix and spent his summers racing. Like all people born and raised on Estehelix, he was made into a betting coin for the Pioneer Project. His life became intertwined with those who came to the entertainment district to strike it rich. With every grand prix win, he began to amass a terrible wealth.
<br>
<br>Raven knew he had an all encompassing mission. He’s a good kid. He spent his childhood growing up in the sheet metal streets and the memoria surgery tables. He spent his childhood getting organs swapped for something more particularized for the environment. He spent his teen years experimenting with what he could do. What he couldn’t. What was expected of him as a rising star and as the primary breadwinner for a decrepit neighborhood. Memoria seeped out of every orifice, it combined with his blood, when he raced, it became a part of his ship.
<br>
<br>The Belladonna, do not touch me.
<br>
<br><b>Are you having fun editorializing?
<br>It’s all “thinking” here. I know it’s your digital kingdom but everything is under my jurisdiction on this system.
<br>What else do you want? 
<br>Do you want to know about the people I slept with for a bit of money? For a piece of bread? Do you want to know about how wide I can open my mouth? 
<br>No? Maybe my dead heat finishes on the grid, then? Do you want to know about the people I had to sabotage to get to where I placed? Do you want to know about my affair with my mentor’s engineer? 
<br>Get out of my brain, [][][][][].
<br>I know you get a kick outta this sorta thing but it’s really pissing me off.
<br>At the end of the day, I lost. I died. I came back like a holy ghost. 
<br>Are you mad I took your girl?
<br>Oh, c’mon. Clearly, it aggravates you.
<br>Or…is it that cuz you can’t do anythin’ about it? 
<br>Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. 
<br>The me that lives, and the me that dies, and the me that lives here. 
<br>In between the lines of reality and dreams. 
<br>That is what Estehelix has always stood for.</b> 

# SunEater
THE SUN EATER | Person of Interest |
<br><b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>Recollection’s beloved executioner and errand dog. A “Record Keeper”.
<br>
<br>She is a cool-headed and cold-hearted woman. Currently out of office on a more demanding mission. She takes her title seriously.
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>Worldly desires? Unnecessary. 
<br>
<br>Love? Romance? Camaraderie? All values to hold close with the capacity to abandon.
<br>
<br>The Sun Eater is a woman of renowned cruelty, but lately, there are rumors swirling around her previous assignment.
<br>
<br>Do not ask her about the Columbine’s final fate. Recollection cannot afford to replace more agents.  
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b>
<br>Moira is not a happy woman. She understands the importance of running a tight ship. She understands the importance of a hierarchy. She understands how she has failed, and how she has succeeded. 
<br>
<br>She is nursing bruises that she cannot articulate.
<br>
<br>She does not care for this world. She does not care for the future. 
<br>
<br>She grinds her axe with the intention of lopping off Recollection’s head. 
<br>
<br>“Was this not the Moira who was kind and levelheaded? A polite, yet charming woman?”
<br>
<br>“Was this not the Moira with a 100% success rate?”
<br>
<br>“Was this not the Moira who brought the Kalmia Project to its knees? The one who was able to save the Columbine?” 
<br>
<br>“I…thought the Columbine died?” 

# Proxima
Proxima | Location | Proxima, the planetary system that started it all. A barren landscape, once filled with the original spacers. Xyetha Corporation built the original space colonies here. 
<br>
<br>Humble in nature, there is nothing glamorous about these colonies. No shiny skyscrapers or towers, this was blue-collared in nature, never blue-blooded in wealth. These colonies were eventually forgotten, its people left to fend for themselves until waste management found the remains. 
<br>
<br>Proxima has three main planets, coded by -I, -II, and -III. Proxi-I has the cistern underground, Proxi-2 has the remains of a great flood, and Prox-3 has been razed down by time and a constant beratement of stars. Very dangerous. All that remains for your parameter is the old warehouse.. Whatever connecting orbital systems that joined these planets no longer work, they travel by ship. 
<br>
<br>If being here is technically against mission parameters, you don’t comment on it. 

# Estehelix
Estehelix | Location | Estehelix, the planetary system of entertainment and vice. Originally ruled by a rich conglomerate until a hostile takeover in 1092X. Lavish skyscrapers and opulent vistas find a silent grave. Eventually condemned as a waste management colony. A great Flight left the place abandoned.
<br>
<br>Known for its memoria basins. Memoria is a liquid that stems from natural reservoirs in the system. It takes the form of an individual’s memories. Not everyone can tap into memoria, but those who are skilled in its control are highly regarded. Charlatans of the highest order.
<br>
<br>Known for its racing circuit, grand theater, and skyline.
<br>
<br>Estehelix has three main planets, coded by -1, -2, and -3. Este-1 has the theater, Este-2 has the circuit, and Este-3 is the commercial and residential area. Each planet is connected by a train of sorts.

# Zinnia
ZINNIA | Person of Interest |  
<br><b>PART ONE:</b>
<br>
<br>Zinnia. Real Name: Forgotten, so far in the past it might not even exist 
<br>
<br>Aspirational and unattainable. Zinnia lives on a plane far higher than yours, yet you both are on equal footing for the first time. She’s been the company’s poster child for so many years it has branded her to a level of immortality. Golden girl, golden child, even her faults don’t let her fall harshly from grace. She lands safely, back on level one. From Employee of the Year, Galaxy’s Hottest Repo Man to Resident PR Disaster, the sway and influence she holds is undeniable.
<br>
<br>You can’t help but get the feeling that she wants to be here. 
<br>
<br>In the middle of the sticks. There’s a level of familiarity from how she walks, like she’s endlessly pulled towards a higher calling. She’s in her reconditioning period, and you’re her handler. How far will you let her leash go? She moves as if there is no leash at all, and with a level of authority that makes you forget that you are in charge. 
<br>
<br>She’s so silent and commanding in company promotional images, you never expected her to be like this. In a universe that ensures that everything should be burned, she puts a lot of stalk in communication. 
<br>
<br>It’s a surprisingly noble outlook. 
<br>
<br>But maybe you shouldn’t be surprised that impassioned speeches would come from someone so noble. 
<br>
<br><b>PART TWO:</b>
<br>
<br>She fixates on sound in ways that's nothing short of fanatical. She tries to be subtle about it, but for such a stoic looking person, subtly isn’t her strong suit. She looks to the world bringing to life the phrase “one person’s trash is another person’s treasure” when the only treasure should be the credits left across the table. 
<br>
<br>But she isn’t motivated by silly things like profit. 
<br>
<br>She dreams bigger than that. 
<br>
<br><b>PART THREE:</b> 
<br>
<br>This isn’t her first rodeo. Reconditioning after reconditioning. Zinnia has broken company policy many times, and has always worked her way back up top. It sounds like a masochistic streak, like she’s someone who gets off on never learning her lesson. 
<br>
<br>Every iteration leaves her a little bit fuzzier, and it takes a moment for her to slot back into place. It’s never been so clear this early before, this quickly. Not until she met you. 
<br>
<br>She’s always had a higher purpose, a noble calling. In the face of watching the world burn, she’s taken a stand again, and again, and again. She’s found music, she’s found joy, she’s found something ancient and attempted to swallow it whole. 
<br>
<br>She’s looking to bring it back. 
<br>
<br><b>If you wanted a noble call to action, you just had to ask.</b> 
<br><b>You know I enjoy monologuing. I can’t help preaching to the choir.</b> 
<br><b>Proxima…it’s a special system. It’s a homecoming. Not that I was raised here, I was raised in a company cage, doomed to be a company pet.</b>
<br><b>Once you hear the world chime, and the levels turn up and down everything changes. You can be a call to action.</b>
<br><b>You can make “music.”</b> 
<br><b>You can do something.</b>
<br><b>I pressed records. I made samples. I served a higher calling.</b> 
<br><b>And then the world erased every single soul who could possibly want to listen.</b> 
<br><b>I was preaching to a graveyard, an underground rave with nothing but ghouls to listen to me mix something powerful.</b>
<br><b>Even that got trampled on.</b>
<br><b>Proxima. It’s my awakening. I was built for this land, and I was built for something beyond it. To collect the world's voices, the soundscapes, the remnants of memories, and combine them into something beautiful.</b> 
<br><b>To remind people of the commandments of this world.</b> 
<br><b>But I don’t really have to spell it out to you do I?</b>
<br><b>You’ve always just seemed to know.</b>
